For this personal project, I analyzed NFL Combine data using Python for data processing and visualization. I started by loading the dataset, which contains player statistics from the NFL Combine, such as physical measurements and performance metrics. Using the pandas library, I grouped the data by year and position to calculate average stats for each position across different years, as well as average stats for each year. I saved these processed results into two CSV files: one for average stats per position and another for average stats per year. To visualize the data, I used matplotlib and seaborn to create charts that help compare player performance metrics over time and across different positions. I set up a dedicated Python environment (nfl_combine_env) to handle dependencies and ensure compatibility. Although there were some issues with NumPy compatibility, I worked through them to ensure the data was processed and visualized accurately. The goal of the project was to uncover trends and patterns in player performances, offering insights into how specific physical attributes or test scores correlate with future NFL success.
